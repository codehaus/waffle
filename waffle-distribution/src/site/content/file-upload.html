  <h2>File Upload</h2>

  <p>
    Waffle provides support for uploading files, using <a href="http://commons.apache.org/fileupload">Commons FileUpload</a>. 
    File uploads are abstracted by Waffle's <a href="javadoc/core/org/codehaus/waffle/io/FileUploader.html">
    org.codehaus.waffle.io.FileUploader</a> interface which can be declared as dependency by the controllers.
    Waffle provides a <a href="javadoc/core/org/codehaus/waffle/io/RequestFileUploader.html">request-based implementation</a>.        
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's walk through an example.  The controller would simply declare the dependency:

  <textarea class="java:nogutter:nocontrols" name="code">
    public class UploadController {
      private final FileUploader;

      public UploadController(FileUploader uploader) {
          this.uploader = uploader;
      }

      @ActionMethod(asDefault=true)
      @PRG(false) // PRG needs to be disabled to allow request-scope content to be accessible in referring view
      public void upload(){ 
        files = uploader.getFiles();
        formFields = uploader.getFormFields();
        errors = uploader.getErrors();        
      }

      public Collection<String> getErrors() {
        return errors;
      }

      public List<FileItem> getFiles() {
        return files;
      }

      public List<FileItem> getFormFields() {
        return formFields;
      }
    }
  </textarea>

  The <code>RequestFileUploader</code> needs to be registered in at request scope, along with any dependency it needs.
  <textarea class="java:nogutter:nocontrols" name="code">
    @Override
    public void request() {
        register("fileItemFactory", DiskFileItemFactory.class);
        register("uploader", RequestFileUploader.class);
        register("upload", UploadController.class);
    }    
  </textarea>

  A few comments are in order:
  <ul>
    <li>By default, Waffle adopts the <a href="prg.html">PRG pattern</a>, 
  which for request-scoped controllers would not allow the content of the request to be made available to the view, because it would be redirected
  to a new request.  Hence, we disable it via the @PRG annotation to show the uploaded files in the referring view.
    </li>
    <li>Waffle honours to the FileUpload interfaces, which allows the implementations and the configuration to be controlled by the
  user via the registrar.  In particular, Waffle by default uses FileUpload's resource cleanup mechanism, detailed in the 
  <a href="http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/using.html">user guide</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
