Build system: 

JDK required: 1.5+
Maven (http://maven.apache.org) required: 2.0.8+
JRuby (http://jruby.codehaus.org) required: 1.0.2+

Build profiles:  

- default: builds all releasable modules
- reporting:  builds reports
- distribution:  builds distribution
- integration:  builds integration tests
- nt: no-test: builds skipping unit tests 
- examples:  builds examples (using profile [jetty|tomcat|geronimo] copies example wars upon install to the appropriate deploy dir)

Note:  profiles are additive and the default profile is always active.
Eg, build with integration tests, reporting and distribution:

mvn -Pintegration,reporting,distribution install

Build and deploy examples to Jetty (skipping tests on releasable modules):

mvn -Pnt,examples,jetty install
