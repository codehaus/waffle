  <h3>Partial page rendering</h3>

  <p>
    By simply having an <i>ActionMethod</i> invoked through an asynchronous call which return <i>Views</i> you'll be
    able to build your web applications to take advantage of partial page rendering.  The View will represent a complete 
    fragment of HTML that the invoking javascript can insert directly into the DOM of the web-app.  Your starting page 
    may be a be something with tabs, and each tab could be loaded after the front tab has been rendered when clicked
    on.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with full pages rendered via JSP or FreeMarker, you can use tools like DreamWeaver to layout the 'div' you are 
    trying to make.  With this style of development you can make full blown Web 2.0 applications like Gmail.
