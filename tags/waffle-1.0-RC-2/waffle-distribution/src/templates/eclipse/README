Waffle blank project

CREATING YOUR PROJECT USING ECLIPSE

1. Unzip the blank project file

2. Copy the entire folder to your workspace with a custom name, i.e.
   'myproject'

3. Enter eclipse

4. Create a new java project with exactly the same name that you have created
   your folder: 'myproject'

	Eclipse will detect all settings which have already been generated for
	you and your project is ready to be used.

DEFAULT INDEX.JSP

	There is already a default index.jsp file which shows how to use the jstl
	fmt	tag library for internationalization.

SOURCE FILES

Add your source files to src/main/java.

RESOURCE FILES

All your configuration files should be placed under src/main/resources.

HTML AND JSP FILES

	All your html, images and jsp files - all files that should be available for
	the end user - should be placed on the web folder.
