  <h2>Component Lifecycle</h2>

  <p>
    Waffle provides lifecycle support which means we can register component with the Registrar that implement
    <b><a href="javadoc/core/org/codehaus/waffle/Startable.html">
        org.codehaus.waffle.Startable</a></b>.  This will allow a component to be started as soon as a context (application,
    session or request) is initialized and stopped when the context is destroyed. This is an extremly useful and
    powerful ability.  With this feature it is possible to register "Janitor" type of components that will
    cleanup resources when their particular context is being destroyed (i.e. closing jdbc resources).
  </p>

  <textarea class="java:nogutter:nocontrols" name="code">
    public class MyStartable implements org.codehaus.waffle.Startable {

      public void start() {
        System.out.println(&quot;I'm being started...&quot;);
      }

      public void stop() {
        System.out.println(&quot;I'm being stopped...bye!&quot;);
      }
    }
  </textarea>

  <p>
    Startable components are registered in the same way as any other component or Controllers within Waffle. And of
    course they will also support Dependency Injection, otherwise your Startable components would be no more useful than
    the example above.
