Waffle and Ajax

    Waffle was built to be easy to develop with and this ease extends to Ajax support as well.  Utilizing AJAX in
    Waffle application is straightforward and simple.  The examples here use the
    {{{http://prototype.conio.net/}Prototype JavaScript Framework}}.

* Ajax Action

    We will create a simple Action with an event (<<int random();>>) that will return a random number between 0 and 10.
    To make it more interesting whenever the value equals 5 the event will throw an Exception.

+-----+
public class FoobarAction implements Serializable {
    private Random random = new Random();

    /**
     * the event
     */
    public int random() throws Exception {
        int value = Math.abs(random.nextInt() % 10);

        if (value == 5) {
            throw new Exception("Random Exception!");
        }

        return value;
    }
}
+-----+

* Ajax-ified View

    So we create a simple View that will periodically (every 2 seconds is the default) request a new value from the Server.

        * We import the prototype javascript file to provide the ajax foundation

        * The custom ajax call is <<new Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater("random", "foobar.action?method=random");>>

            * The first argument <<"random">> refers to the element id tag in the html (the <\<div\>>)

            * The second argument <<foobar.action?method=random>> represents what will be periodically called to the server.

                * <<foobar.action>> the Action is registered under the key value "<foobar>".

                * "method=random" signifies that the "random" ActionMethod method will be called on the Action.

+-----+
<html>
<head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/prototype-1.4.0_rc3.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        new Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater("random", "foobar.action?method=random");
    </script>
</head>
    <h1>Random value from Server: <div id="random"></div></h1>
</html>
+-----+

* Wire it up with the Registrar

    The <FoobarAction> is registered under the name "<foobar>".  Notice that the Action is being registered
    to the Application level context (via the annotation <<@RegisterWithApplication>>).  

+-----+
public class CustomRegistrar extends AbstractRegistrar {
    public CustomRegistrar(Registrar delegate) {
        super(delegate);
    }

    @RegisterWithApplication
    public void application() {
        register("foobar", FoobarAction.class);
    }
}
+-----+

* Partial page rendering

    By simply having an <ActionMethod> invoked through an asynchronous call which return <View>'s you'll be able to
    build your web applications to take advantage of partial page rendering.

    TODO ... need example!!! ...
