<h2>Testing Waffle Applications</h2>
<h3>Custom Registrars</h3>
<p>Waffle provides a built-in test case for verifying that your
Custom Registrar (the class extending AbstractRegistrar) can satisfy all
dependencies. To utilize this test case extend the abstract class
&quot;RegistrarTest&quot;. Here is an example of testing the
HelloWorldRegistrar:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>public class HelloWorldRegistrarTest extends RegistrarTest {
    public void testDependenciesAreSatisfied() {
        assertConfiguration(HelloWorldRegistrar.class);
    }
}</pre></div>
<p>Yep, that is all the code necessary to test your Custom
Registrar.</p>
</div>
<h3>Controllers</h3>
<p>Controllers are extremely easy to test with JMock. Let's write a
test to verify the following:</p>
<p>The &quot;save&quot; ActionMethod on a the AutomobileController
will save the Car being configured to a Database (via the AutomobileDAO
interface).</p>
<p>Preconditions:</p>
<p>- A &quot;Car&quot; exists in the users session</p>
<p>So here is an example of how this could be done. We'll first
write a test to ensure that the &quot;save&quot; ActionMethod on
AutomobileController does what we expect it to.</p>
<div class="source"><pre>public void AutomobileControllerTest extends MockObjectTestCase {
    public void testSaveEvent() {
        Car car = new Car();

        Mock mockDAO = mock(AutomobileDAO.class); // AutomobileDAO is an interface
        mockDAO.expects(once()).method(&quot;save&quot;).with(eq(car));
        AutomobileDAO automobileDAO = (AutomobileDAO)mockDAO.proxy();

        Mock mockHttpSession = mock(HttpSession.class);
        mockHttpSession.expects(once())
            .method(&quot;getAttribute&quot;).with(eq(&quot;Car&quot;))
            .will(retunValue(car));
        HttpSession httpSession = (HttpSession)mockHttpSession.proxy();

        AutomobileController controller = new AutomobileController(httpSession, automobileDAO);
        controller.save();
    }
}</pre></div>
<p>So the test is first creating an instance of the Car object for
use within the test. A mock is created to stand in for the AutombileDAO.
We are expecting that the AutomobileDAO will have it's
&quot;save(Car):void&quot; method called one time. A mock is also
created for HttpSession. We are expecting the
&quot;getAttribute(String):Object&quot; method to be called on the
HttpSession mock one time, and when it is called it will return the
instance of Car we have previously created. Then we build the
AutomobileController satisfying its dependencies with the mocks we have
created and execute it's &quot;save():void&quot; method.</p>
<p>Look how great this is, we can test this controller in complete
isolation. No dependency on a database in order to test this and no need
to actually have a running servlet container. Now it is time to
implement the &quot;save():void&quot; method in the AutomobileController
to satisfy our test.</p>
<div class="source"><pre>public class AutomobileController {
    private final AutomobileDAO automobileDAO;
    private final HttpSession httpSession;

    public AutomobileController(HttpSession httpSession, AutomobileDAO automobileDAO) {
        this.automobileAction = automobileAction;
        this.httpSession = httpSession;
    }

    public Car getCar() {
        return (Car)httpSession.getAttribute(&quot;Car&quot;);
    }

    public void save() {
        Car car = getCar();
        automobileAction.save(car);
    }
}</pre></div>
<p>Wow, the controller is pretty small and simple. But I feel we can
still improve the design. So let's keep going with the Agile approach
and refactor this to an even simpler solution. Utilizing the
ActionMethod firing support built into Waffle we can change the
&quot;save&quot; method to expect a Car instance passed to it, therefor
eliminating the dependency on an HttpSession. So we will refactor the
test.</p>
<div class="source"><pre>public void AutomobileControllerTest extends MockObjectTestCase {
    public void testSaveEvent() {
        Car car = new Car();

        Mock mockDAO = mock(AutomobileDAO.class);
        mockDAO.expects(once()).method(&quot;save&quot;).with(eq(car));
        AutomobileDAO automobileDAO = (AutomobileDAO)mockDAO.proxy();

        AutomobileController controller = new AutomobileController(automobileDAO);
        controller.save(car);
    }
}</pre></div>
<p>The test now only mock the AutomobileDAO exactly as it did
before. An HttpSession is no longer needed in the Action. So what
changed? We'll have a look at the &quot;save&quot; method on the
Controller. It now expects an instance of a &quot;Car&quot; to be passed
to it. Running the test will cause the controller to fail, so let's
refactor the Controller to satisfy the test.</p>
<div class="source"><pre>public class AutomobileController {
    private final AutomobileDAO automobileDAO;

    public AutomobileController(AutomobileDAO automobileDAO) {
        this.automobileAction = automobileAction;
    }

    public void save(Car car) {
        automobileAction.save(car);
    }
}</pre></div>
<p>Now that is a pretty simple controller, and no internal
dependency on an HttpSession makes the test simpler too. Another thing
to note, prior to the refactoring the AutomobileController needed to be
registered to the Session Level context (in the Registrar). However
after the refactoring the Action can be registered higher, to the
Application Context Level, which will allow it to be shared across the
application.</p>
