<h2>Waffle Web Framework</h2>

<p>Waffle is a Java web framework that makes the process of
developing Java based web applications easier. It was built to support
enterprise level web-based business applications, but with the least
possible number of source lines to achieve that.</p>

<p>Waffle is different than the multitude of web frameworks that
exist today. Waffle :</p>
<ul>
  <li>does <b>NOT</b> have any mandatory XML configuration files
  beyond a minimalist web.xml required by any J2EE-compliant webapp</li>
  <li>does <b>NOT</b> have a steep learning curve</li>
  <li>does <b>NOT</b> have a proprietary UI templating language</li>
  <li>does <strong>NOT</strong> force you to extend base classes or
  implement interfaces</li>
  <li>does <strong>NOT</strong> have a cumbersome series of setter
  methods and an execute method for controllers</li>
</ul>

<p>Application built upon Waffle only need to be aware of three
things:</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Controllers</b> - an controller in Waffle does <b>not</b>
  need to extend or implement any specific class or interface because <b>a
  controller is simply a plain old Java object (POJO)</b>.</li>
  <li><b>ActionMethod</b> - in Waffle <b>an ActionMethod is
  simply a method defined in your Controller class</b>. Any method can be
  used regardless of its signature or return type. Waffle will react
  differently depending on what is returned from the ActionMethod so
  take a look at this section for further details.</li>
  <li><b>Registrar</b> - the Registrar is where you go to register
  the <i>Controllers</i>, and other common components, your application
  is dependent on. Typically most web frameworks require your
  applications to create special XML file(s) for this, but <b>with
  Waffle you'll spend less time playing with XML and more time building
  business logic.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, Waffle provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transparent REST functionality for controllers.</li>
  <li>Transparent JSON functionality for controllers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>The best way to get started is to look at the examples</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="hello-world.html">Example: Hello World</a></li>
  <li><a href="simple-calculator.html">Example: Simple
  Calculator</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Choices of markup language</h3>
<p>As Waffle does not come with a HTML markup technology, it plays
well with other 'best practice' solutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JSP with or without supplied taglibs</li>
  <li>Freemarker</li>
  <li>Velocity</li>
  <li>Ruby's ERB</li>
</ul>
