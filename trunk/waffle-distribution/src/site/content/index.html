<h2>Waffle Web Framework</h2>

<p>Waffle is a Java web framework that makes the process of
developing Java based web applications easier. It was built to support
enterprise level web-based business applications, but with the least
possible number of source lines to achieve that.</p>

<p>Waffle is different from the multitude of web frameworks that
exist today, in that Waffle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>has no mandatory XML configuration files
  (beyond a minimalist web.xml required by any J2EE-compliant webapp)</li>
  <li>is interoperable with best-of-breed UI templating technologies</li>
  <li>does not have a base&nbsp;controller class to extend or interface to implement</li>
  <li>has controller classes that can support multiple actions, each a single method<b></b> rather than a sequence of initialiation/settter/execute methods</li><li>has a small learning curve</li>
</ul>

<p>Application built upon Waffle only need to be aware of three
things:</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Controllers</b> - in Waffle <b>a
  Controller class is simply a plain old Java object (POJO)</b>, ie it does <b>not</b>
  need to extend or implement any specific class or interface.</li>
  <li><b>Action Method</b>&nbsp;- in Waffle <b>an Action Method is
  simply a method defined in your Controller class</b> (and optionally annotated with @ActionMethod). Any method can be
  used regardless of its signature or return type. Waffle will react
  differently depending on what is returned from the ActionMethod, see
  <a href="action-methods.html">Action Methods</a> for further details.</li>
  <li><b>Registrar</b> - the Registrar class is where the <i>Controllers</i>, 
  and other components your application depends on, are registered. 
  Typically, most web frameworks require your applications to create special XML file(s) 
  for this, but int Waffle <b>Registrars are Java objects that allow you to implement
  your business logic more efficiently</b>.  Of course, Waffle does allow - 
  but <b>does not mandate</b> - a Registrar to read a configuration from a file,   
  be it XML or a scripting language.  
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, Waffle provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transparent REST functionality for controllers.</li>
  <li>Transparent JSON functionality for controllers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choices of markup language</h3>
<p>As Waffle does not come with a HTML markup technology, it plays
well with other 'best practice' and established solutions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JSP - with or without supplied taglibs</li>
  <li>Freemarker</li>
  <li>Velocity</li>
  <li>Ruby's ERB</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>The best way to get started is to look at the examples</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="hello-world.html">Example: Hello World</a></li>
  <li><a href="simple-calculator.html">Example: Simple
  Calculator</a></li>
</ul>
