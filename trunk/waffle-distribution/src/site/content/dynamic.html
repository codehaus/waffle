<h3>Partial page rendering</h3>

<p>By simply having an <a href="action-methods.html">ActionMethod</a> invoked through an asynchronous call which
return <a href="views.html">Views</a> you'll be able to build your web applications to take advantage of partial page
rendering. The View will represent a complete fragment of HTML that the invoking javascript can insert directly into the
DOM of the web-app. Your starting page may be a be something with tabs, and each tab could be loaded after the front tab
has been rendered when clicked on.</p>
<p>As with full pages rendered using JSP or <a href="http://freemarker.org">FreeMarker</a> views, you can use
HTML-editing tools (such as supported in modern IDEs or using standalone tools like DreamWeaver) to layout the 'div' you
are trying to make. With this style of development you can make full blown Web 2.0 applications like Gmail.</p>
