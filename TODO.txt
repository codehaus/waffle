
TODOs:

- Add tiles support via sitemesh and later tiles2

- Add waffle-tablig component

- Add support for a configurable mapping of the view components.
At present, a /name.action expects a /name.jspx.  
It would be better if we could keep the top-level name.action but allow the mapping to a view that is not necessarily in the same dir structure, eg in /jspx/name.jspx.
We can register action with "jspx/name" but that exposes dir structure in the action url - which is not desirable.
   
- Support jsp forwards: 
If a user attempts 

<jsp:forward page="/name.action"/>

org.apache.jasper.JasperException: Exception in JSP: /index.jsp:1

1: <jsp:forward page="/name.action"/>

Stacktrace:
	org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.handleJspException(JspServletWrapper.java:504)
	org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service(JspServletWrapper.java:393)

root cause

com.thoughtworks.waffle.WaffleException: Request level container was not found make sure that a WaffleRequestFilter was registered in the web.xml

Oddly, the direct url http://localhost:8080/name.action works fine.

- Vanilla submit does not seem to working - needs javascript:fireMethod
We should also include essential javascript in distro.
(Adding default method annotation should fix this)

- allow client state to be persisted to the client (Base64?)
