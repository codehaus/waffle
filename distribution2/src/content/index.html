Any method can be used regardless of its signature or return type. Waffle will react differently depending on what is returned from the ActionMethod so take a look at this section for further details.</li><li><b>Registrar</b> - the Registrar is where you go to register the <i>Controllers</i>, and other common components, your application is dependent on. Typically most web frameworks require your applications to create special XML file(s) for this, but <b>with Waffle you'll spend less time playing with XML and more time building business value.</b></li></ol><div class="section"><h3>Getting started</h3><p>The best way to get started is to look at the examples</p><ul><li><a href="helloworld.html">Example: Hello World</a></li><li><a href="simple-calculator.html">Example: Simple Calculator</a></li></ul></div></div>
